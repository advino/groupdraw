# groupdraw

Groupdraw is a small experiment in shared-ownership.

Most software today operates on an all in one modality where users have complete access to all functionality from the start. Groupdraw seeks to question this through the means of a browser-based drawing board.

Groupdraw restricts certain tools based on how many additional users there are sharing the network. A certain number of users must be 'seeding' or supporting the network in order for the tool to have certain functionality.

What if a tool's effectiveness was a function of the level of attention and support it received?
